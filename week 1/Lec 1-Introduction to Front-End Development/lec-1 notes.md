# Lesson# 1 - Introduction to Front-End Development


You surely would have come across multiple websites and may have seen varying styles, colors, themes, and layouts of these websites. Look at the figure below. It is the Login page of Facebook. You can see the title “Facebook” written in blue, placed on the left side of webpage and a form to the right side of the same page. There are two buttons; one is the “Log In” button colored blue while the second is for creating a new account colored in green. What you can notice is a proper structure and layout of this webpage. This way of structuring and rendering things on a webpage is what we call front-end development. It primarily deals with the look and feel of a webpage.



**What are the tasks involved in Front-End Development?**

Now that you have some idea of what front-end development is. Let us look into some tasks specific to a front-end developer. A front-end developer is responsible for structuring content by following the User Interface (UI) design, which is the job of a web designer. Analysis of code and visual presentation of content in a way that not only is it responsive but also pertains to user experience, all these tasks are managed by a front-end developer.

**Difference between Front-End and Back-End**

Have you ever noticed that Facebook’s login page always remains the same? Whenever you open that webpage, it always displays a form to log in and sign up. On the other hand, your Facebook news feed webpage is always changing and displaying latest posts by your friends and followed pages. If you look at your news feed of Facebook, you can see a search bar on top-left of the page, below it are Facebook stories, your contacts on the right, and then there is space in the middle for news feed. That is all what a front end is, the things you can view, how they are displayed, what styles are applied and what fonts are used. Front-end constitutes of the interface with which the user interacts.

However, there is another side of the same webpage. Do you wonder how you are actually able to see latest posts by your friends? Your news feed is updated after every few minutes. You can view people’s stories every day. All these posts and stories change with time and display on the same page. That is where back-end development comes.

A front-end developer can tell a web browser that how it shall structure the content you want to display. A back-end developer on the other hand will program things in a way that every time new data can be populated in the same page without disturbing the styles and layout of webpage. A user cannot understand or see how dynamic data is being delivered to him on a webpage and that is why it is referred to as bank-end. Back-end developers work on making webpages dynamic and interactive.

**HTML, CSS and JavaScript**

As described in above video, technologies used on the front-end of webpages are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You can analyze the difference in purpose of each the three languages in the figure below.
