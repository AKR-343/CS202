# Lesson# 2 â€“ URL - Uniform Resource Locator



**What is the World Wide Web?**

The World Wide Web, commonly known as The Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators, which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.

**What is a Web Address?**

The web address contains information about the location of the webpage. It is also known as the URL . Like the address for your home, a web address organizes information about a webpage's location in a predictable way.


Example: https://www.vu.edu.pk/


**The ASCII Character Set**

ASCII stands for the "American Standard Code for Information Interchange". It was designed in the early '60s, as a standard character set for computers and electronic devices. ASCII is a 7-bit character set containing 128 characters. It contains the numbers from 0-9, the upper and lower-case English letters from A to Z, and some special characters. The character sets used in modern computers, in HTML, and on the Internet, are all based on ASCII.



**What is a URL?**

A URL is another word for a web address. A URL can be composed of words (e.g. example.com), or an Internet Protocol (IP) address (e.g. 192.68.20.50). Most people enter the name when surfing, because names are easier to remember than numbers. Web browsers request pages from web servers by using a URL. A URL is used to address a document (or other data) on the web.


**What is a protocol identifier?**

The protocol identifier indicates the name of the protocol to be used to fetch the resource.


Example: http://example.com

The example uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is typically used to serve up hypertext documents. HTTP is just one of many different protocols used to access different types of resources on the net.


**What is a Dynamic URL?**

A dynamic URL is the address or URL of a Web page with content that depends on variable parameters that are provided to the server that delivers it. The parameters may be already present in the URL itself or they may be the result of user input.

If the content of a web site is stored in a database and pulled for display on pages on demand, dynamic URLs maybe used. In that case the web site serves basically as a template for the content.

Usually, a dynamic URL would look something like this:

http://code.google.com/p/google-checkout-php-sample-code/issues/detail?id=31.

You can spot dynamic URLs by looking for characters like: ? = & etc.
