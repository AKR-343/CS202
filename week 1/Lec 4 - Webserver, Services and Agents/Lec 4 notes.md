# Lesson# 4 – Web Server, Services and Agents


**What is a server?**

In computing, a server is a piece of computer hardware or software that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients". This architecture is called the client–server model.





**What is a client?**

A client is a piece of computer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server as part of the client–server model of computer networks. The server is often on another computer system, in which case the client accesses the service by way of a network.

**What is an API?**

API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you’re using an API.

**Understanding XML**

Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. XML is a markup language much like HTML. XML was designed to store and transport data. Typically, Web Service resides on a Web Server use XML to communicate messages. XML is just information wrapped in tags.

**XML example**
```xml
<note>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>
```

**The XML above is quite self-descriptive:**
---
It has sender information.

It has receiver information

It has a heading

It has a message body.

The XML language has no predefined tags.
---

The tags in the example above (like ```<to>``` and ```<from>```) are not defined in any XML standard. These tags are "invented" by the author of the XML document.

**The Difference Between XML and HTML**

XML was designed to carry data with focus on what data is. HTML was designed to display data with focus on how data looks. XML tags are not predefined like HTML tags are.
