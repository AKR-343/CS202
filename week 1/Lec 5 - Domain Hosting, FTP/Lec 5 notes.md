# Lesson# 5 – Domain, Hosting, FTP


**What is a Domain Name?**

A domain name is a unique, easy-to-remember address used to access websites, such as 'google.com', and 'facebook.com'. Users can connect to websites using domain names thanks to the DNS system.


**What is DNS?**

The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. When users type domain names such as ‘google.com’ or ‘nytimes.com’ into web browsers, DNS is responsible for finding the correct IP address for those sites. Browsers then use those addresses to communicate with origin servers to access website information. This all happens thanks to DNS servers: machines dedicated to answering DNS queries.

**What is Web hosting?**

Web hosting is a service that allows organizations and individuals to post a website or web page onto the Internet. A web host, or web hosting service provider, is a business that provides the technologies and services needed for the website or webpage to be viewed in the Internet.

**What is a packet?**

Packets are the basic units of communication over a TCP/IP network. Devices on a TCP/IP network divide data into small pieces, allowing the network to accommodate various bandwidths, to allow for multiple routes to a destination, and to retransmit the pieces of data which are interrupted or lost. Each piece is a packet, a term interchangeable with datagram.


**What is TCP?**

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) – a connection-oriented communications protocol that facilitates the exchange of messages between computing devices in a network.


**What is FTP server?**

An FTP Server (which stands for File Transfer Protocol Server) is a software application which enables the transfer of files from one computer to another. 

If you send files using FTP, files are either uploaded or downloaded to the FTP server. When you’re uploading files, the files are transferred from a personal computer to the server. When you’re downloading files, the files are transferred from the server to your personal computer.

**What is FTP Client Software?**

An FTP Client is a software designed to transfer files back-and-forth between a computer and a server over the Internet. It needs to be installed on your computer and can only be used with a live connection to the Internet.

With an FTP Client uploading/downloading a file is really easy. Furthermore, FTP clients have some extra features. For example, you can resume a download that did not finish successfully. This is a very nice feature for people with slower Internet connections.
