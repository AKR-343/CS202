# Lesson# 6 – Fundamentals of HTML


 **What is HTML?**

HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and web applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.

**Hyper Text**

 HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.

**Markup language**

 A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.

**Web Page:**

 A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A web page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.

Hence, HTML is a markup language which is used for creating attractive web pages with the help of styling, and which looks in a nice format on a web browser. An HTML document is made of many HTML tags and each HTML tag contains different content.

**HTML Tags**

HTML tags are like keywords which defines that how web browser will format and display the content. With the help of tags, a web browser can distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content. HTML tags contain three main parts: opening tag, content and closing tag. But some HTML tags are unclosed tags.

An HTML file must have some essential tags so that web browser can differentiate between a simple text and HTML text. You can use as many tags you want as per your code requirement.

All HTML tags must enclosed within < > these brackets.

Every tag in HTML perform different tasks.

If you have used an open tag` <tag>`, then you must use a close tag </tag> (except some tags)

**Syntax**

`<tag> content </tag>`

**What is Meta data?**

Metadata is data (information) about data. <meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings. Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.

**Example:**
```html
<head>  
<meta charset="UTF-8">  
<meta name="description" content="Virtual University">  
<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">  
<meta name="author" content="John Doe">  
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">  
</head>
```
**What is a search engine?**

A search engine is a software program that helps people find the information they are looking for online using keywords or phrases.

Search engines are able to return results quickly—even with millions of websites online—by scanning the Internet continuously and indexing every page they find.

When a user enters a search term, the search engine looks at the website page titles, contents and keywords it has indexed and uses algorithms (step-by-step operations) to produce a list of sites—with the most relevant websites at the top of the list.
